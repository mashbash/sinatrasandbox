- If I have multiple input fields in varying formats on my page, when the values gets passed, which 
  params are picked up on the view (.erb) page?
answer: all params get picked up unless you are specific about which key you are referring to, so if you

When I add new form element names to my textarea form:
It throws up and error because naming it post[description] makes it a nested hash and it won't
be able to read the value. If I had to use that same naming syntax, then I would have to put
params[:post][:description] to make it work but it is convoluted to do it that way.
